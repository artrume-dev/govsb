Make Your Business More Productive With AI.
AI engines decide what brands appear.AI agents decide how work gets done.

THE AI SHIFT
Discovery, Decision & Action Now Begin Inside AI.
Consumers no longer start with Google.They begin by asking AI:
		“What’s the best solution for my team?”
		“Which product is most reliable?”
		“Plan my trip   and book the best options.”
		“Find the top software for small businesses.”
AI engines generate the answers.Agentic systems complete the actions.
The funnel collapses from 6 steps to 1.Query → Recommendation → Purchase.
There are no pageviews.No landing pages.No scroll depth.No retargeting window.
Meanwhile, inside organisations, the same transformation is happening:AI agents are now automating research, writing, analysis, operations, planning, reporting, and thousands of micro tasks per day.
If your brand doesn’t surface in AI, you’re invisible.If your teams don’t leverage agents, you’re slow.
VISIBI ensures you stay visible and competitive.

WHY THIS MATTERS
The New Competition Happens Inside the Model   Not on the Webpage
Before:Awareness → Search → Visit → Read → Compare → Buy
Now:Prompt → AI → Answer → Purchase
If you are not part of the model’s reasoning set:You don’t get recommended.
If agents can’t understand your data:You don’t get selected.
VISIBI solves both visibility and action:We ensure your brand appears when AI is making the decision —And we ensure your business operates at modern, agent powered speed.

 FAQ
Who is VISIBI for?
VISIBI is built for brands, agencies, and enterprises who:
Want to be visible, trusted, and recommended by AI engines.
Are you serious about a structured, measurable AI strategy, not hype?
See AI as both a new discovery layer and a new workforce.
If you care about how AI finds you and how AI helps you work, you’re our fit.

What exactly is GEO?
GEO (Generative Engine Optimisation) is the discipline of making your brand:
Understandable to AI models
Accurately described in AI answers.
Cited and recommended in relevant prompts
Positioned correctly against your competitors
If SEO is about ranking in search results, GEO is about being chosen inside AI answers and agent workflows.
How is GEO different from SEO?
		SEO optimises content and websites for traditional search engines.
		GEO optimises entities, context, citations, and signals so AI engines and agents can interpret and recommend your brand.
You still need SEO   it feeds data into AI systems.GEO sits on top of SEO, shaping how AI uses that data.
Which AI platforms do you optimise for?
		We focus on the AI systems that people actually use to make decisions:
		ChatGPT
		Gemini
		Claude
		Perplexity
		Copilot
		DeepSeek
		Grok
		Cohere
Plus, emerging AI assistants and agent frameworks as they gain adoption.
What types of AI agents do you build?
		We design and deploy agents that do real work, not just chat:
		Marketing agents (content, reporting, optimisation)
		Sales agents (qualification, routing, CRM updates)
		Support agents (triage, resolutions, escalations)
		HR agents (screening, onboarding, policy Q&A)
		Finance agents (reconciliation, forecasting, reporting)
		Operations & IT agents (workflows, diagnostics, log analysis)
		eCommerce agents (recommendations, checkout, cart logic)
		All built with governance, guardrails, and auditability in mind.
How long until we see results?
		GEO / AI Visibility
	o	Early improvements in how AI describes your brand can appear in weeks, as we fix entities, structure, and authority signals.
	o	Deeper impact (citations, recommendation frequency, sentiment) typically builds over 1–3 quarters, depending on your starting point.
		AI Agents
	o	Targeted, single domain agents (e.g., a single workflow) can go live in 2–8 weeks, depending on complexity, integrations, and risk requirements.
We’ll give you a realistic timeline during the initial audit.
Do we need a large internal AI team to work with you?
No. You need:
		A decision maker
		A technical or product owner for integration
		Stakeholders from key teams (e.g., marketing, sales, ops)
We handle GEO strategy, technical implementation, and agent design.You stay focused on priorities, approvals, and adoption.
How do you handle data privacy and security?
We design with safety and compliance first:
		Clear guardrails and permissions for each agent
		Use of approved APIs and secure connectors
		No unnecessary data sharing with third party models
		Configurable access control, logging, and audit trails
We work with your internal security and legal teams to ensure compliance with your standards. Additionally, our service includes continuous compliance monitoring and regular security reviews to provide ongoing support and reassurance to decision makers. This ensures that your data privacy and security needs are consistently met and aligns with evolving industry standards.


What does working with VISIBI look like in practice?
Most engagements follow this structure:
	1.	Free AI Visibility & GEO Audit
	1.	Prioritisation of GEO and/or agent opportunities
	1.	Implementation sprint (GEO foundations and/or first agent)
	1.	Measurement & iteration (visibility, performance, usage)
	1.	Scale up phase (more entities, more agents, more workflows)
You can start small and expand once you see value.
Can we start with just the free audit?
Yes. The Free AI Visibility Audit is the safest first step:
		No obligation
		No heavy lift from your side
		Gives you a clear view of where you stand in AI today
From there, you decide whether to move forward with GEO, agents, or both.
