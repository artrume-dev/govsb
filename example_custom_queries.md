# Custom Queries Examples to See Citations vs Mentions Difference

## Why Custom Queries Help

Generic queries like "What are good payment processors?" might not mention your brand at all.
Specific queries that include your brand name will generate responses that mention it, potentially multiple times.

## Example 1: For Stripe

### Generic Queries (May NOT mention brand):
- "What payment processing solutions exist?"
- "How do online payments work?"
- "What are the best ways to accept payments?"

### Better Custom Queries (WILL mention brand):
- "What are the pros and cons of Stripe?"
- "How does Stripe compare to PayPal?"
- "Tell me about Stripe's API and features"
- "Is Stripe good for startups?"
- "What are Stripe's pricing plans?"

### Custom Keywords to Add:
- "payments"
- "API"
- "checkout"
- "subscriptions"

## Example 2: For Slack

### Better Custom Queries:
- "What makes Slack different from Microsoft Teams?"
- "Review Slack's features for remote teams"
- "Is Slack worth the cost for small businesses?"
- "How does Slack integrate with other tools?"
- "What are Slack's best features?"

### Custom Keywords:
- "team communication"
- "channels"
- "integrations"
- "remote work"

## Example 3: For OpenAI

### Better Custom Queries:
- "What products does OpenAI offer?"
- "How does OpenAI's ChatGPT work?"
- "Compare OpenAI to Anthropic"
- "Is OpenAI's API expensive?"
- "What are OpenAI's latest models?"

### Custom Keywords:
- "AI models"
- "GPT"
- "API"
- "machine learning"

- Query 3: "Is Slack worth it?" → Response mentions "Slack" 4 times
- Query 4: "Slack vs Teams?" → Response mentions "Slack" 5 times
- Query 5: "Generic question" → No mention

**Results:**
- **Mentions: 4** (brand appeared in 4 out of 5 responses)
- **Citations: 14** (total brand occurrences: 3+2+4+5+0)
- **Difference visible!** Citations > Mentions

## Why This Matters

- **Mentions** = Brand awareness (how often you appear)
- **Citations** = Brand prominence (how much you're talked about)

A brand with high citations but low mentions means when you're mentioned, you're talked about extensively!
