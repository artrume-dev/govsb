      "sample_response": "The best UI design tool for web design can vary based on your specific needs, preferences, and the type of project you are working on. However, as of my last knowledge update in October 2023, here are some of the most popular and widely regarded UI design tools for web design:\n\n1. **Figma**: \n   - A cloud-based design tool that allows for real-time collaboration. It's great for UI/UX design, prototyping, and feedback. Figma's vector graphics capabilities and extensive plugin ecosystem make it a favorite among designers.\n\n2. **Adobe XD**:\n   - Part of the Adobe Creative Cloud, XD is designed for wireframing, UI design, and prototyping. It integrates well with other Adobe products and offers collaboration features.\n\n3. **Sketch**:\n   - A vector graphics editor for macOS that has become a standard in UI/UX design. It offers a wide range of plugins and is ideal for designing interfaces and prototypes.\n\n4. **InVision**:\n   - Primarily a prototyping tool, InVision allows designers to create interactive mockups for web and mobile applications. It also offers collaboration features and integrates with other design tools.\n\n5. **Axure RP**:\n   - A powerful tool for creating wireframes and interactive prototypes. It offers advanced features for creating complex interactions and is often used for larger projects.\n\n6. **Webflow**:\n   - A design tool that allows designers to create responsive websites visually, without needing to write code. It combines design, CMS, and hosting in one platform.\n\n7. **Canva**:\n   - While more focused on graphic design, Canva can be useful for creating UI assets and mockups, especially for those who may not have extensive design experience.\n\n8. **Affinity Designer**:\n   - A vector graphic design tool that is a strong alternative to Adobe Illustrator, suitable for creating UI designs and assets.\n\n9. **Marvel**:\n   - A design and prototyping tool that is user-friendly and great for creating simple designs and interactive prototypes quickly.\n\n10. **Protopie**:\n    - A prototyping tool that excels in creating high-fidelity prototypes with complex interactions without requiring any coding.\n\nWhen choosing a UI design tool, consider factors like collaboration features, ease of use, integration with other tools, platform compatibility, and your specific project requirements. Many of these tools offer free trials, so you can test them out before making a decision.",
